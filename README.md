## (WIP) Long-Tailed Recognition with Prototype Classifiers
An implementation of https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.00491.pdf

TODO
- [x] Cosine/L2 distance
- [x] Class-dependent temperature
- [ ] Hyperbolic distance
- [ ] Verifying paper's hyperparameters / tuning
- The paper argues that prototype learning is most optimal with a high prototype learning rate (lr=4.0). However, it does not converge in this implementation.
